# Guessing_Game
A Java Project


In the project, I created a game that allows computer to generate a random secret value. The player is then asked to guess that value. If the players's value is less than the computer's value, the computer displays "higher", if the players's value is greater than the computer's value, the computer displays "lower", and if the players's value is same as the computer's value, the game ends and the computer displays "You got it!" with a number of the amount of guesses the player had to take to finally guess the secret number.
